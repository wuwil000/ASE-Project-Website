# Our Team

### William Wu
William Wu is currently a rising senior at Stratford High School (2022). He plans to pursue a STEM related career, mostly likely related to computer science. He started coding at a very young age but didn’t take it seriously until he started to program for his robotic competitions in VEX IQ. He has experience in competitive robotics for roughly three years in middle school and started doing competitive coding since sophomore year such as participating in UIL as a junior where Stratford placed third place and doing USACO competitions. He is participating in CS club, BPA, NHS next year, and Focus Points. His skill set includes being able to code in Python, C++, and Java, having experience in all of Stratford’s engineering classes, problem solving and adaptability through his experiences in competitions, general understanding of robotics, and hands-on tasks due to mechanical work at home through robotics. Outside of his career and academic interests, William is heavily interested in marine biology, history, art, and philosophy. He spends the majority of his free time on drawing, and reading.

### Ivan Chan
Ivan Chan is a rising senior in Stratford Highschool (2022). He loves science and math, and is planning to major in Mechanical Engineering. He knows how to program in python and has taken all of the engineering courses offered at Stratford Highschool. He has also participated in many extracurricular STEM activities like Nasa Highschool aerospace scholars and Houston Prep at UHD. Ivan participates in Mu Alpha Theta, CS club, NHS, Focal Points Club, the Stratford Orchestra, and Academy of Science and Engineering.  Outside of his career and academic interests, Ivan is interested in  bouldering, stand-up comedy , and tutoring kids Algebra. For fun, He likes to hang out with his friends, play video games, and write jokes. 

### Caleb Xu
Caleb is a rising senior in Stratford High School (2022). In addition to having taken all computer science and engineering courses offered at Stratford. Outside of school, Caleb programs competitively in the US Computing Olympiad as well as for fun. He knows Java, Python, and JavaScript. He was a lab leader at LetsCodeSpringBranch, a student-led free summer coding camp which taught over 50 middle and elementary schoolers how to program using python. In the district regional UIL competition, he placed 4th out of 30 competitors, with his team placing 3rd. Caleb has honed rapid problem solving skills and knowledge of programming and engineering. He is a very hands-on person and thrives in settings where he can apply himself. Caleb plays on Stratford’s varsity lacrosse team and has been playing since freshman year. He is also a 2x state qualifier for the BPA Java Programming competition, and is founder and president of the Focal Points club. In his spare time, he enjoys programming, shooting lacrosse balls into his neighbors’ yards, and writing.

### Sep 10, 2022
Researched heavily on existing designs of tranmissions and how they operate. Started creating basic general ideas of how the robot and tranmission system will work. Drew out baisc blueprints of the systems and robots which are attached as photos below. 
(We decided to make the tranmission only two speed due to size contraints.)

### Sep 16, 2022
Started creating and assembling the tranmission and wheel system that was deigned previously. Also we started clalculating amount of parts necessary for the project. We currently require 4 big gears, 1 medium ~36 tooth gear, 3 small 12 tooth gears, along with two servo motors.
Some issues we ran into were lacking parts to connect the base pieces at 45 degrees which we decide to possibly make makeshift ones in the future. 
After many iterations we finally managed to get a rough and basic design of the tranmission and plan on incopratting the servo to be able to shift gears next meeting. Pictures are attached below:

### Sep 23, 2022
Had a group meeting at William's house and started constructing more transmissions. (Created the basic form of 3/4 needed transmission systems so we made 2 more this meeting and don't have enough supplies to start on the last one) We ran into issues over the gear shifting servo mechanism as the plate that is supposed to shift the gear system twists and turns instead of actually moving the axle. It may need adjusting and redesigning. Our need list is also expanding as we also need more 2" standoffs and the 45 degree angle parts. Pictures are attached below of the process and products created this meeting:

### Sep 30, 2022
Continued assembling the transmission systems and tested and attempted different ways of making the motor subsystem that moves the shaft to shift the transmission between gear ratios. We have one working one by heavily modifying the design and structure but still need to test it using code and actual motor driven movement which we will try next meeting. There were issues with our original design of this subsystem and need more parts to make it work which we will need to pick up this week. There is bit of concern about the clearance of the gears when they shift, but decided to make changes only when it becomes an issue. Pictures of results are below along with a link to a video demonstrating the working transmission prototype we created.

- Replaced transmission support frames with sturdier pieces
- Constructed remaning transmission gears
- Completed vehicle base, used aluminum plates to connect all 4 transmissions
